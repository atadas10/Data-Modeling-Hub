## Use Case:

The auto insurance application sends automated renewal reminders to policyholders nearing their policy expiration date. When a policy is approaching renewal, the system retrieves policy details, including renewal date and coverage options. It then triggers personalized notifications via email or SMS, reminding the policyholder to renew their policy before expiration. The reminder includes information on premium payment options and any available discounts for early renewal. Upon receiving the reminder, the policyholder can review their coverage needs and conveniently renew their policy online through the application. This feature ensures timely policy renewals, reduces lapse risks, and enhances customer satisfaction.

### Functionality
1. Policy Management: Store and manage details of insurance policies including policyholder information, coverage details, premium payments, and policy terms.
2. Claims Processing: Track and process insurance claims filed by policyholders, including claim details, status updates, and settlement information.
3. Customer Management: Maintain customer profiles with contact information, policy history, and communication preferences.
4. Premium Calculations: Calculate insurance premiums based on factors such as vehicle type, driver age, driving history, and coverage options.
4 Renewal Reminders: Send automated reminders to policyholders for policy renewals, premium payments, and updates on policy terms.
5. Agent Management: Manage agent profiles, commissions, and performance metrics for sales and customer service.
6. Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and analytics on policy sales, claims trends, customer demographics, and business performance.
7. Document Management: Store and organize policy documents, contracts, and communication records for easy access and retrieval.
These functionalities will help streamline operations, enhance customer service, and improve decision-making within the auto insurance application.

## Implementation Details

1. Policy Management:

Choice of Model Type:

For an auto insurance application with relational data and complex relationships between entities, a normalized relational model would be the most suitable choice. While NoSQL databases could be suitable for certain aspects of the application, such as storing unstructured data or handling high volumes of transactions, they might not be the best fit for the overall data model due to the structured nature of insurance data and the need for complex relationships and queries. However, depending on specific requirements, a hybrid approach combining relational and NoSQL databases could also be considered.

### Relational Model:

Tables:
Policy Table (policy details)
Policyholder Table (policyholder information)
Coverage Table (coverage details)
Relationships:
Policyholder has a one-to-many relationship with Policy
Policy has a many-to-many relationship with Coverage
Functions:
CRUD operations for policies and policyholders
Query policies by policyholder
Add or update coverage for a policy
NoSQL (Optional):

Scenario:
Storing policy documents (PDFs, images) which may vary in structure.
Implementation:
Use a NoSQL document store (e.g., MongoDB) to store policy documents.
Store metadata in the relational database and link to corresponding documents in the NoSQL database.
2. Claims Processing:
Relational Model:

Tables:
Claim Table (claim details)
Policy Table (foreign key to link claims with policies)
Relationships:
Policy has a one-to-many relationship with Claim
Functions:
Record new claims and update claim status
Query claims by policy
Calculate claim settlements
NoSQL (Optional):

Scenario:
Storing unstructured data such as claim photos or scanned documents.
Implementation:
Use a NoSQL database to store unstructured data associated with claims, such as images or text documents.
3. Customer Management:
Relational Model:

Tables:
Policyholder Table (customer details)
Functions:
CRUD operations for policyholders
Query policies by customer
4. Premium Calculations:
Relational Model:

Tables:
Premium Table (premium payment details)
Functions:
Calculate premiums based on policy details and risk factors
Record premium payments
5. Renewal Reminders:
Relational Model:

Tables:
Communication Table (communication details)
Functions:
Schedule and send renewal reminders via email or SMS
Log communication events
NoSQL (Optional):

Scenario:
Storing communication history with customers, which may have variable structure.
Implementation:
Use a NoSQL database to store communication logs in a flexible schema.
6. Agent Management:
Relational Model:

Tables:
Agent Table (agent details)
Functions:
CRUD operations for agents
Track agent performance metrics
