# 1. Introduction to Data Vault 2.0 Modeling

## 1. What is Data Vault 2.0?
Data Vault 2.0 is a modeling technique designed for building scalable and flexible data warehouses. It follows a hub-and-spoke architecture that separates business keys from descriptive attributes, providing a robust foundation for integrating disparate data sources.

## 1.2. Key Principles and Objectives
Data Vault 2.0 emphasizes agility, scalability, and auditability. Its key principles include:
- Separation of business keys and descriptive attributes
- Scalability through the use of hubs, links, and satellites
- Flexibility to accommodate changing business requirements
- Traceability and auditability for regulatory compliance

# 2. Components of Data Vault 2.0

## 2.1. Hubs
Hubs represent the core business entities and serve as the central repositories for business keys. They provide a unique list of all business keys, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## 2.2. Links
Links establish relationships between hubs, forming the backbone of the data model. They capture the associations and connections between different business entities, enabling comprehensive data analysis.


## 2.3. Satellites
Satellites store descriptive attributes related to hubs and links. They contain historical and contextual information, such as timestamps, source system details, and changes over time, facilitating data lineage and analysis.
